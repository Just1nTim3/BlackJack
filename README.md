# BlackJack

This is Black Jack game which you can play in your console.

It main purpose was to practise Java and learn git :)

To play a game you have to launch code and just type "yes" or "no" in console. Program will ask if you want do draw a card 
and if your hand value will be more than 21 it wont allow you draw another card and you automatically lose. If game is finished,
no matter of result [win / loss / draw] program will ask if you want to play another game. Program is also counting your won and
lost games. 

I might add multiple player option and betting system in the future.
